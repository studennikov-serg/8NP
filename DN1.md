# Brahmajāla Sutta – the “Supreme Net” of Views

The **Brahmajāla Sutta (DN1)** earns its name *Brahmajāla* (“Supreme Net”) because it weaves an all-encompassing “net” of wrong views.  In this long discourse the Buddha systematically surveys **62 speculative doctrines** held by wanderers and brahmins (for example, the eternalist claim “*The self and the world are eternal*”), showing how each doctrine stems from clinging and ignorance.  Although the word *jala* (net) does not appear in the dialogue itself, the structure is like a net’s mesh: every conceivable wrong view is caught.  By detailing these views – from belief in an eternal self (sassatavāda) to various forms of nihilism and equivocation – the sutta exposes how beings get **ensnared** by their conceptual frameworks.  In effect, anyone holding one of these views remains “caught in the net” of that view, unable to break free.

## Net and trap imagery in early discourses

The Pāli Canon frequently uses **net and trap metaphors** for the bonds of craving and ignorance.  For example, in the *Taṇhā Sutta* (AN 4.199) the Buddha explicitly calls craving the *“ensnarer”* (*jaalino*) that spreads out and catches beings:

> “I will teach you craving: the ensnarer that has flowed along, spread out, and caught hold, with which this world is smothered and enveloped like a tangled skein… and does not go beyond transmigration, beyond the planes of deprivation, woe, and bad destinations.”

Here *tanhā* (craving) is likened to a fisherman’s cast-net that *smothers and envelops* the world – in other words, the entire round of rebirth is “caught” by craving.  Similarly, the Dhammapada observes that only a few escape the blind net of samsāra.  Verse 174 likens ordinary life to darkness where *“few only can see”* and *“few only go to heaven, like birds escaped from the net.”*  This simile explicitly names a “net” on the path out of the world: only those who break free as birds from a hunter’s net attain the heavenly goal, while most remain ensnared by ignorance.

Other suttas speak of **bondage and traps** in related imagery.  In SN 35.63 the monk Migajāla is told that *“infatuation brings bondage, and a monk who is trapped in the bondage of enjoyment is called ‘one who dwells with a mate’”*.  Here *bondage* and *trapped* translate Pāli words implying a snare or imprisonment – craving and clinging are the “mates” that keep one yoked to continued becoming.  The ten **fetters (saṃyojanas)** too serve as metaphorical bonds; the Buddha lists them (first fetter = identity-view, last = ignorance) as the chains tying beings to saṃsāra.  In this sense, clinging to any of the Brahmajāla’s sixty-two views is like adding another loop in the net or another shackle in the bond, ensuring that “wherever \[the trapped being] emerges and tries to get out, \[they are] caught and held” by the net of views (commentarial simile).

## How Brahmajāla’s structure reflects a net

The **purpose and structure** of DN1 reinforce the net imagery.  The sutta is essentially a “catalog” of views – each presented as a *case* or scenario (“This, bhikkhus, is the first case… second case… up to sixty-second case”). In each case the Buddha shows how a recluse’s reasoning or meditative insight leads to a particular philosophical view or an equivocation (e.g. endless doubting or refraining from any stance). By exhaustively enumerating them, the discourse leaves **no hole** in the net of wrong thinking.  In effect, any wanderer who holds any of these views finds it documented here, illustrating how one becomes **entangled** in it.

Finally, the sutta (and its tradition) emphasizes remembering this teaching *as* a net.  After the exposition, Ānanda asks for a title, and the Buddha calls it **the “Net of the Good,” “Net of the Dhamma,” “Supreme Net,” “Net of Views,”** etc. (the precise canonical text is a late colophon, but this traditional title underlines the metaphor).  In sum, Brahmajāla casts wide a net of doctrinal snares – analogous to craving and ignorance binding all who cling – so that beings “caught in these sixty-two grounds” of view are shown their error and ideally liberated from the net when the truth (the Noble Eightfold Path) is understood.

**Key canonical parallels:** In early discourses craving is repeatedly likened to an ensnaring net and few escape the net of worldliness.  The ten fetters bind the unwise.  Thus Brahmajāla’s scope – all conceivable wrong views – plays the same role: it is an *all-embracing net* catching the defilements of wrong view. By systematically dismantling each view, the sutta serves as a “net remover,” helping listeners cut through the net of speculation that binds them.
