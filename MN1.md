# Mūlapariyāya Sutta (MN 1): The Root of All Things

This discourse systematically exposes how every **dharma** (phenomenon) can become a root of attachment when misperceived.  The Buddha speaks first to “an untaught ordinary person” (puggo appamattako; *puthujjana*) and then to a trainee (sekha) and finally to the arahant (and Tathāgata).  He enumerates a comprehensive sequence of objects—from the four elements (earth, water, fire, air) through beings and gods to the subtlest states (‘the seen, heard, sensed, cognized,’ unity/diversity, “the All,” and finally Nibbāna).  After each item the same refrain is repeated, showing how that object is perceived and *conceived* by each person.  For example:

“Here, bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person… perceives **earth as earth**.  Having perceived earth as earth, he conceives \[himself as] earth, he conceives \[himself] in earth, he conceives \[himself apart] from earth, he conceives earth to be ‘mine,’ he **delights in earth**.  Why is that? Because he has not fully understood it, I say.”.

The Buddha repeats this pattern for each subject.  The effect is to cover *all* experience from gross to subtle.  Thus even “he perceives Nibbāna as Nibbāna… conceives Nibbāna to be ‘mine,’ delights in Nibbāna” if he lacks insight.  These formulaic refrains drive home a single point: without true understanding, every perception is followed by an obsessive self-reference (I/mine), revealing how **perception plus naming leads to proliferation of grasping**.

## Sequence of Objects (“Elements to Nibbāna”)

The sutta’s listing is deliberate and exhaustive.  It starts with the four physical elements—earth, water, fire, air—and then includes sentient beings, celestial gods (devas of increasing sublime jhāna realms), the highest Brahma (the Overlord), and the four formless jhāna bases (infinite space, consciousness, nothingness, neither-perception-nor-non-perception).  It then moves to sense-experiences (“the seen, the heard, the sensed, the cognized”) and to conceptual polarities (“unity, diversity, the All”).  Only at the end does it mention **Nibbāna**.  By wrapping every category of experience with the same formula (“perceives X as X… conceives X to be ‘mine’…”), the Buddha shows that *no aspect of experience is exempt from self-clinging*.  Even the sublime goal (Nibbāna) can be mistakenly “possessed” if misunderstood.  The repeated refrain underscores that **not comprehending the true nature of each phenomenon** (aniccā, dukkha, anattā) leads to this clinging pattern.

* *Bullet point (for clarity):* The objects listed form a progression from gross matter to increasingly subtle phenomena, culminating in Nibbāna. The logic is to cover “the root of all things” – demonstrating that at every level, the ordinary mind will grasp at “I” and “mine” unless abandoned.

## Three Perspectives: Puthujjana, Sekha, Arahant

The discourse is structured around three types of person, distinguished by their insight:

* **Untaught ordinary person (puthujjana):**  He “perceives **X** as **X**” for each item, but then immediately *conceives* it in self-referential ways.  The translation shows him conceiving “himself as earth… in earth… apart from earth,” calling earth *“mine,”* and delighting in earth.  In short, he identifies with and clings to X because “he has not fully understood it”.

* **Disciple in training (sekha):**  The trainee is characterized by developing insight.  He **“directly knows X as X”** instead of merely perceiving it.  The Buddha instructs: having directly known earth as earth, **he should not** conceive earth to be his or delight in it.  In other words, the trainee recognizes the object correctly but must consciously *refrain* from the habitual conceiving-and-delighting (i.e. from naming and proliferating thoughts).  This restraint is “so that he may fully understand it”.  Thus the sekha no longer *actually delights* in X, although the capacity to do so still exists; he must actively refrain to complete his insight.

* **Worthy One (arahant/Tathāgata):**  The arahant also **“directly knows X as X,”** but now there is no self-conceiving at all.  He “does not conceive earth to be ‘mine,’ does not delight in earth,” because he has *fully understood it*.  This formula is repeated for each X.  The key difference is the stated *reason*: the arahant’s mind is freed by wisdom and the eradication of defilements.  In one passage the Buddha adds that the arahant “is **free from lust through the destruction of lust**” (and similarly “free from hate” and “free from delusion” in later verses).  In sum, whereas the worldling clings out of ignorance, the arahant has no ignorance or passion to fuel the conceiving.

These roles show the progressive stages of insight: from unawareness (taking each phenomenon as self), through mindful restraint (knowing it and avoiding clinging), to full liberation (no clinging at all).  The Tathāgata/Buddha receives a final mention (his perspective is identical to the arahant), emphasizing that he **“has fully understood \[each phenomenon] to the end”**.

## Perception, Naming and Proliferation

Underlying this scheme is a psychological doctrine: every sense-experience gives rise to a chain of mental events.  First comes **perception** (*saññā*): e.g. seeing an earth-coloured form.  Then comes **conceptual naming** (*paññatti*): one labels and categorizes it (as “earth”).  Next follows **mental proliferation** (*papañca*): one builds thoughts around it – “I am earth; earth is part of me; etc.” – which leads to **identity-view** (*sakkāya-diṭṭhi*) and attachment.  The sutta dramatizes this by saying “he conceives \[himself] as X… in X… apart from X, he conceives X to be ‘mine’”. These phrases collectively depict the multiplying of concepts after a perception.

In early Buddhist terms, the ordinary person’s chain is: sensory contact → perception → proliferation → self-view.  Many canonical suttas (e.g. MN 18, SN 12.48–49) make this explicit: perception is followed by papañca, leading to conceit and dissatisfaction.  In **Mūlapariyāya** the repeated refrain illustrates precisely how *avijjā* (ignorance) at the root causes each perception to be colored by “I” and “mine.”  By contrast, when perception is paired with *sammā-saññā* (right perception) in the sekha or arahant, it does not trigger proliferation.  They “directly know X as X” without adding the extra mental narrative, breaking the chain at the very root.

## Connection to Dependent Origination

The teaching here dovetails with *paṭicca­samuppāda*.  In effect, the sutta is unpacking the first links: ignorance (avijjā) about the nature of phenomena leads to clinging (upādāna).  Crucially, the Buddha links this clinging to the cycle of birth and death.  In the final passage the Tathāgata says he “has understood that delight (*abhinaññāna*), is the **root of suffering**, and that with being (bhava) as condition there is birth (jāti), and for what has come to be there is ageing and death”.  He then explains that by eliminating this delight (papañca, craving) one awakens fully.  This language explicitly invokes dependent origination: *abhisaṅkhāra* (delight/craving) conditions bhava, which conditions jāti, etc.  In other words, the misperception described in MN 1 is the very psychological root of the *samsāra*-cycle.

Thus **Mūlapariyāya** shows that ending suffering requires uprooting the conceiving-and-proliferating that occurs “at the root” of experience.  As long as mind grasps phenomena as “self” or “mine,” dependent origination continues; once that is dropped, the cycle is cut off.  The sutta repeatedly emphasizes this by the refrain “because he has not fully understood it” (for the ordinary person) versus “because he has fully understood it” (for the arahant/Tathāgata). This final statement – that seeing “delight” (craving) as the root ends the cycle – ties the entire discourse back into the core doctrine of conditioned co-arising.

In sum, the Mūlapariyāya Sutta uses its formulaic structure to *disassemble* our ordinary mode of experience. By showing how each perception is normally answered with naming and proliferation, the Buddha reveals the hidden fetter of self-view in every dharma.  The cure, as the sutta concludes, is to reverse this process: to **directly know phenomena as they are** without adding “I/mine,” thereby breaking the root of attachment and halting the process of rebirth.
