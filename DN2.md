# Dīgha Nikāya 2 (Sāmaññaphala Sutta – The Fruits of the Contemplative Life)

## Context: King’s Question and Worldly View

King Ajātasattu, still troubled by his deeds, asks the Buddha: *What is the “fruit of the contemplative life” (sāmaññaphala)*?  He frames the question in purely worldly terms.  For example, he lists ordinary craftsmen (archers, weavers, accountants, etc.) and notes that *“They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here and now. They give pleasure and refreshment to themselves, to their parents, wives, and children…leading to a heavenly rebirth”*.  His notion of “fruit” is immediate comfort, reputation and even a heavenly reward.  Implicitly, he wonders whether a monk (samana) can obtain any comparable benefit here and now by renouncing worldly life.

*Terms:* “sāmaññaphala” literally means *“fruit (phala) of the ascetic or contemplative life (sāmañña)”* – i.e. the benefits one gains from becoming a samana.  Ajātasattu’s worldview at the start is narrowly materialistic: he expects *visible* results of spiritual life just as a craftsman sees the products of his labor.

## The Six Contemporaries and Their Answers

Before consulting the Buddha, the king had posed the same question to six leading ascetics of his day.  In each case they answered with their fixed doctrines, none giving a concrete “fruit” at all:

* **Purāṇa Kassapa (akiriyavāda, “non-action”)** – He denied any moral consequences to action.  When asked about the fruit of contemplative life, *“Purāṇa Kassapa answered with non-action”*, essentially saying that even killing or generosity produces no karmic fruit.
* **Makkhali Gosāla (fatalism)** – He taught that beings are controlled entirely by fate.  He replied that “beings are defiled without cause… purified without cause,” a doctrine summarized as **“purification through wandering-on”**, offering no skillful path or result.
* **Ajita Kesakambalī (ucchedavāda, annihilationism)** – He claimed that personhood ends at death.  He said there is “no fruit or result” of good or bad deeds and that with death *“the wise and foolish alike are annihilated”*.
* **Pakudha Kaccāyana (eternalist atomism)** – He posited seven eternal, unchanging substances.  He answered by reciting these seven (earth, water, fire, wind, pleasure, pain, soul) that do not influence each other, an answer of **“non-relatedness”**, likewise ignoring the question.
* **Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta (Mahāvīra, Jina)** – He praised the austere fourfold restraint (non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy) as the mark of his followers, but this rigid code offered no new *fruit*.  The king reports simply that “Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta answered with fourfold restraint”.
* **Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta (skepticism)** – He famously answered every question with a string of “maybe / maybe not” statements.  The sutta notes that *“Sañjaya Belatthaputta answered with evasion”*, completely avoiding the question of any result in the present life.

In each case the teaching was irrelevant to Ajātasattu’s query – like answering “breadfruit” when asked about “mango.”  The king found all these replies dissatisfying, neither rejecting them outright nor finding any delight in them.  The sutta uses these exchanges to contrast the **Buddha’s pragmatic method** with the rigid, dogmatic stances of his contemporaries.

## The First Two Visible Fruits: Honor and Support in This Life

The Buddha begins by showing that even on a mundane level, the *monastic life yields immediate gains*.  He asks the king to imagine a devout servant or head of household who goes forth as a monk.  For example, the king says he would *not* demand the return of a slave who ordains; instead “I should bow down… invite him to accept gifts of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites… provide him with righteous safety, defense, and protection”.  In other words, society (even the king) honors and sustains anyone who leaves the household life for monasticism.

* **First visible fruit:** The social respect and patronage accorded to a new monk.  When the king hears a loyal slave has become a monk, he promises to treat him with the highest honor (bowing, gifts, protection).  The Buddha affirms that this is *indeed* a “visible fruit of the contemplative life” here and now.  He explicitly calls it *“the first fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now”*, i.e. a benefit that the monk enjoys even before liberation.

* **Second visible fruit:** The same respect applies to any layperson-turned-monk.  The Buddha asks about a wealthy householder who renounces; Ajātasattu acknowledges the same honor would be due.  The Buddha then labels this outcome *“the second fruit… visible here and now”*.  In short, the immediate **worldly fruits** of renunciation are tangible support and admiration from family and society.  These answers ground the conversation in reality, contrasting with the abstract evasions of the other teachers.

## The Gradual Training: Virtue, Jhāna, and Insight

After establishing the *visible fruits*, the Buddha launches into a detailed, step-by-step outline of the monk’s training.  This is the heart of the sutta: a systematic path leading from basic morality to concentration to wisdom.  Each stage is presented as a higher “fruit” of contemplative life.

* **Consummate Virtue (Sīla):**  First the monk perfects his morality.  The sutta describes in detail how he *abandons taking life, taking what is not given, unchastity, false speech, divisive or harsh speech, idle chatter*, and all other unwholesome acts.  He keeps the Vinaya rules, refuses forbidden livelihood (no fortune-telling, no damaging seeds, etc.).  Endowed with such virtue, *“he sees no danger anywhere”* in his restraint.  In fact he delights inwardly in his purity, “sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless”.  In other words, perfect virtue itself becomes an abiding source of ease and security.

* **Sense-Restraint and Mindfulness:**  Next the monk guards his senses.  On seeing a form or hearing a sound, *“he does not grasp at any theme or details by which… greed or distress might assail him”*.  This vigilant sense-restraint (indriya-saṃvara) ensures sense-objects do not disturb his mind.  At the same time, *“in all postures – walking, standing, sitting, lying, eating, speaking, breathing, etc.”* he acts with full mindfulness and alertness.  He is *appamāda*- vigilant in each moment.  Because of this disciplined awareness, he is entirely free from regret or remorse.

* **Contentment:**  The monk is described as being extremely content.  Having only robes and almsfood, *“he is content… with a set of robes to provide for his body and almsfood to provide for his hunger… he takes only his barest necessities along”*.  Just as a bird flies with its wings as its only burden, the monk needs nothing extra.  This simplicity of life further stabilizes the mind.  Contentment with little prevents anxiety and desire for more, and thus supports inner peace.

* **Abandoning the Five Hindrances:**  With virtue, restraint and contentment established, the monk deliberately enters solitude and meditation.  He then turns his awareness inward and *“abandons covetousness… ill will… sloth and torpor… restlessness and remorse… and doubt”*.  The sutta uses powerful similes: the hindrances are like debts, sickness, prison, slavery, or a desert road.  When they are removed, the monk experiences great joy and rapture.  *“He becomes glad… enraptured, his body grows tranquil. …Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.”*.  In short, liberation from lust, anger, laziness, worry and uncertainty brings intense bliss and the settling of the mind.

Each of these stages is presented not merely as doctrine but as concrete experiences of “fruit.”  The monk at this point lives in perfect morality and mindfulness, sees its peace, and is well prepared for deep concentration.  The Buddha emphasizes that this whole moral and mental purification leads to abiding happiness in the present life – not only in some remote afterlife.

## Jhāna: Blissful Abidance (*diṭṭhadhammasukhavihāra*)

With the hindrances gone and the mind ready, the monk “enters and remains” in the four **jhānas** – meditative absorptions.  The sutta gives vivid accounts of each jhāna, noting that each in turn is *“more excellent and sublime”* than the last:

* **First Jhāna:** “rapture and pleasure born from seclusion” accompanied by directed thought.  The text says he “permeates and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal”, using a simile of moist bath-powder permeated by water.
* **Second Jhāna:** “rapture and pleasure born of composure” with unified awareness and without directed thought.  Here pleasure is purer; a simile describes a cool spring filling a lake.
* **Third Jhāna:** “equanimous & mindful with pleasant abiding.”  The rapture fades away and is replaced by a calm, even pleasure, like cool water saturating lotus plants.
* **Fourth Jhāna:** “purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.”  The meditator abides in bright, purified awareness, as if cloaked entirely in white.

Each of these is explicitly called *“a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now”*.  In traditional terms, this bliss of concentrated mind is the *diṭṭhadhammasukhavihāra* – literally “dwelling happily in the seen phenomena.”  In other words, the jhānic joys are supreme current-life fruits of practice, radically different from the mundane fruits the king expected.

## Insight and Higher Knowledges (*Abhiññā*)

Beyond jhāna bliss, the monk develops profound insight.  The Buddha describes how the concentrated mind now penetrates reality:

* **Insight into the elements:**  With a purified, imperturbable mind the monk contemplates his own body: *“This body of mine is composed of the four primary elements… subject to inconstancy… dissolution”*.  He sees clearly that even his own life is conditioned and decaying.  (This direct insight is a fruit of meditative purity.)

* **Psychic Powers (Iddhi):**  The text then explains that he can “become many, become one, appear, vanish, pass through walls as if through space, dive in and out of earth as if it were water… Sitting he flies through the air like a winged bird”.  In short, mastery over the mind confers extraordinary abilities (multiplying body, teleportation, flying, even influencing distant worlds) just as a skilled artisan shapes clay.  These *abhiññā* are listed as fruits of the contemplative life.

* **Divine Ear (Dibba-sota) and Mind-Reading:**  The monk develops “the divine ear,” hearing any sound, human or divine, near or far.  He also attains telepathy: he knows another’s mind, discerning whether it is filled with passion, aversion, delusion, and even whether it is liberated or not.  Again, these are results of his one-pointed concentration.

* **Recollection of Past Lives:**  The sutta explicitly says he recollects “manifold past lives” – any birth in any realm, along with name, clan, lifespan and experiences of pleasure or pain.  He mentally travels through innumerable lifetimes in sequence, as easily as one might recall traveling from village to village.

* **Divine Eye (Catu-p-apāta-dassana):**  By the purified “divine eye” he *sees* all beings dying and being reborn, in accordance with their karma.  He discerns who falls into hell, who rises to heaven, based on their past virtue or vice.  This knowledge of the moral order of the universe is again a contemplative fruit.

All these higher knowledges (**cha-ḷa-bhiññā** of the Commentaries) are framed as achievements available to a monk of consummate concentration.  But the sutta does not stop with supernatural powers.  It culminates in the ultimate **freedom**:

* **Arahantship (Release of the Fermentations):**  Finally, with mind still, the monk comprehends fully the Four Noble Truths.  He *“discerns…: ‘This is stress… the cessation of stress… the way to its cessation…’”* and similarly for the intoxicants (*āsavas*) of sensuality, becoming, and ignorance.  The text says his heart is *“released”* from these fermentations.  He directly knows **Nibbāna**: *“Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.”*.  The Buddha then declares that this final liberation is the supreme fruit of contemplative life: *“no fruit more excellent or sublime”* exists.

In summary, the Buddha’s answer moves from ordinary to extraordinary: first human honor and support (visible fruits), then ethical purity, jhāna bliss, and finally liberating insight.  Each stage is the fruit of the previous, illustrating the full **gradual training (anupubba-sikkhā)**.  The teaching is practical: it starts where the king’s mind is (visible rewards) and lifts him step by step into the deepest wisdom.

## Aftermath: Arahantship and Taking Refuge

Ajātasattu is awestruck.  He exclaims *“Magnificent, lord! … like carrying a lamp into the dark… just so has the Blessed One made the Dhamma clear”* and declares, *“I go to the Blessed One for refuge”*.  He also repents of killing his father, and the Buddha accepts his confession as sincere.  (The sutta notes that, had he not committed that crime, Ajātasattu might himself have reached the first path on the spot.)  In any case, the king leaves fully convinced of the value of the monastic path.

**Key terms:** The title *sāmaññaphala* means the “fruit” of becoming a **sāmaṇera / bhikkhu**.  The Buddha’s use of *diṭṭhadhammasukhavihāra* (implicitly in describing jhāna bliss) refers to dwelling in the happiness of present phenomena (the meditative bliss here and now).  The experience of *nibbidā* (disenchantment) is implied in the final insight: once the truths are seen, the mind becomes disenchanted with all conditioned things, leading naturally to dispassion and *nibbāna*.

Throughout the sutta each level is given full doctrinal and practical meaning.  The Buddha never denigrates worldly fruits, but shows how they pale next to the fruits of practice.  By contrast to the six inflexible teachers, he unfolds a complete path tailored to the seeker’s stage: from ethical virtue (sīla), to deep concentration (jhāna), to the highest wisdom (paññā) and freedom.  The **progression** – moral cleansing, mindful seclusion, jhānic bliss, penetrating insight, and final liberation – demonstrates the gradual training that leads a person from craving to the ultimate fruit of arahantship.

**Sources:** The above analysis closely follows the Pāli discourse as preserved in the Tipiṭaka.  Key passages are cited from the sutta (translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu) to illustrate each stage.
